# exam-preparation
You want to prepare for any exams for Full Stack Web jobs, primarily on PHP. You want to gather all the essentials concepts you have learned so far to a single place. 

# Concepts
> You want to cover the broad categories of major concepts on full stack web dev, without using any framework, or any major libraries. You can however, use libraries for development purposes, e.g. phpunit, and codeception. 
Each concept must have tests (acceptance/unit) as needed, you don't use functional tests since you're not using any frameworks.
