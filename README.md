Preparation for an exam. No frameworks: routing. 

# Concepts
> You want to cover a broad categories of major concepts on full stack web dev, without using any framework, or any major libraries. You can however, use libraries for development purposes, e.g. phpunit, and codeception. 
Each concept must have tests (acceptance/unit) as needed, you don't use functional tests since you're not using any frameworks.
